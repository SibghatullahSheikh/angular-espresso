{"name":"Angular Espresso","tagline":"Based on angular-seed, a great starting point for writing an AngularJS app running on an Express backend, written in CoffeeScript","body":"# Angular Espresso\r\n\r\nStart an app with AngularJS on the client, Express + Node + Socket.IO as your back-end, all written in CoffeeScript.\r\n\r\n## Current version\r\n\r\nCurrent version: 0.1.0\r\n\r\nThis version includes the following components:\r\n\r\n* AngularJS 1.0.5\r\n* Twitter Bootstrap 2.3.1\r\n* Express 3.1.0\r\n* Socket.IO 0.9.14, client 0.9.11\r\n* Jade 0.28.2\r\n* UglifyJS 2.2.5\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nYou need to have installed node (http://nodejs.org/) and CoffeeScript (http://coffeescript.org/), make sure\r\nyou install globally\r\n\r\nOnce you have them installed, run:\r\n\r\n> npm install\r\n\r\n## Cakefile Usage\r\n\r\nOnce you install the dependencies, use the Cakefile for performing different actions:\r\n\r\n> cake build                # Builds app\r\n> cake build:module         # Builds the Espresso module\r\n> cake build:client         # Builds client scripts\r\n> cake clean                # Clean module and client\r\n> cake clean:module         # Cleans the Espresso module\r\n> cake clean:client         # Cleans the Espresso module\r\n> cake run                  # Builds and runs the app\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\nThere's no configuration for using Angular Espresso, all you need to do is clone/fork the project, install its\r\ndependencies with npm and run your node app.\r\n\r\nYour .coffee files should be under the \"app\" folder. The structure is the following:\r\n\r\nNOTE: Each directory has a README file with more detail\r\n\r\n* Angular: Your AngularJS app should go in this directory\r\n* Services: Backend logic goes here\r\n* Config: Configuration that may be used to set up different values for a specific environment or a common config\r\n* Routes: This directory should contain the routing functions for your views. Define an entry point for a major\r\ncomponent of your site and then use partials for all its sub-components\r\n* Resources: Any client scripts not related to AngularJS\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\nFor more on AngularJS: http://angularjs.org\r\n\r\nFor more on CoffeeScript: http://coffeescript.org\r\n\r\nFor more on Express: http://expressjs.com\r\n\r\nFor more on Jade: http://jade-lang.com","google":"UA-39417110-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
